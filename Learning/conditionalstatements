# JavaScript Conditional Statements
JavaScript conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.

if Statement
The if statement is used to specify a block of code that will execute only if a condition is true.

Example:
// Check if the number is positive
let number = 5;
if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
}
Single-Line Comments Example:

// Declare a variable and assign a value
let number = 10;

// Check if the number is even
if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("The number is even"); // Logs if the number is even
}
if...else Statement
The if...else statement specifies a block of code to execute if the condition is true and another block if it is false.

Example:

// Check if the number is positive or negative
let number = -3;

if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("The number is negative");
}
Multi-Line Comments Example:

/*
This block of code checks if a number is positive or negative
and logs the result to the console.
*/
let number = 0;
if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("The number is zero or negative");
}
if...else if...else Statement
This allows you to test multiple conditions.

Example:

// Check the grade of a student
let marks = 85;

if (marks >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (marks >= 50) {
    console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: F");
}
Preventing Execution with Comments Example:

let age = 18;

/*
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote");
}
*/

// The above block is commented out for testing purposes
console.log("Testing alternative conditions...");
Ternary Operator (Short Conditional Syntax)
The ternary operator is a shorthand for if...else.

Example:

// Check if a number is even or odd
let number = 7;
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
console.log(result);
Commenting in Ternary Example:

// Using the ternary operator to check the condition
let age = 20;

// Determine eligibility for voting
let eligibility = (age >= 18) ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible to vote";

console.log(eligibility); // Logs the eligibility status
