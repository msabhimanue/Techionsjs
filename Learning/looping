# Looping in JavaScript
Looping is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Simple Loops: for Loop
The for loop is the most commonly used loop.

Example:
// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Logs each number
}

Iteration: for...of and for...in
for...of (Used for iterable objects like arrays):
// Iterate over an array
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); // Logs each fruit
}
for...in (Used for object properties):
// Iterate over object properties
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]); // Logs each key-value pair
}
