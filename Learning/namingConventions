# Naming Conventions in JavaScript

Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example:

Variable and function names written as camelCase
Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
Should you use hyp-hens, camelCase, or under_scores in variable names?

This is a question programmers often discuss. The answer depends on who you ask:

Hyphens in HTML and CSS:
HTML5 attributes can start with data- (data-quantity, data-price).
CSS uses hyphens in property-names (font-size).

# Hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names.

Underscores:
Many programmers prefer to use underscores (date_of_birth), especially in SQL databases.
Underscores are often used in PHP documentation.

PascalCase:
PascalCase is often preferred by C programmers.

camelCase:
camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.

# Do not start names with a $ sign. It will put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names.
