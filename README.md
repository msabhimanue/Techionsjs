# Techionsjs
This project is designed to simplify and guide beginners through making their first contribution. If youâ€™re new and want to make your first contribution, follow the steps below for a clear understanding.
# Naming Conventions
A naming convention in JavaScript is a set of rules and guidelines for naming variables, functions, and other identifiers to ensure code consistency, readability, and maintainability, as explained in the namingConvention file.
# Comments in JavaScript
Comments in JavaScript can be used to to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code , as explained in the comments file.
# DataTypes,Type Conversion and Variables in JavaScript
Data types in JavaScript specify the type of data, such as numbers, strings, or objects, that can be stored in a variable.
Type conversion in JavaScript changes one data type to another, like turning a string into a number. This can be done manually or automatically by JavaScript.
Variables are Containers for Storing Data , as explained in the dt,tp&variables file.
# Operators in JavaScript
Javascript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations, as explained in the operators file.
# Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
# Looping
Looping enables repetitive execution of code until a specified condition is met.
# Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be invoked with or without arguments.
# String Methods
String methods are built-in functions that allow you to manipulate and analyze string data in various ways.
# Array Methods
Array methods provide tools for performing operations like adding, removing, or iterating over array elements.
# Looping - Simple Looping - Iteration
Iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing a set of instructions, typically achieved using loops like for, while, or forEach.
# Maps
Maps are collections of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type and maintain their insertion order.
# Sets
Sets are collections of unique values that automatically discard duplicates and allow efficient value checks.
# Objects - Properties, Methods, Constructors
Objects are collections of key-value pairs (properties) that can include methods (functions) and constructors for creating object instances.
